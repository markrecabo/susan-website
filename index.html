                        Based upon reliable and accurate results from the most state-of-the-art food sensitivity test available, you'll know exactly what foods and/or food chemicals are causing your digestive symptoms. Susan will develop your individual foods plan so that you always know exactly what to eat. Your deit will be expanded to incorporate a variety of healthy foods, which can then be enjoyed with no digestive repercussions at all! During this time of food reintroduction, Susan will also guide you through an individual protocol to heal the gut lining, which is where to problem often starts. This helps to assure that you do not develop new food sensitivities, which could result in problems down the road. She will also teach you how to maintain a healty gut lining by using either supplements or foods, or perhaps a combination of both.

                            After the first two weeks I was starting to feel better and slowly started losing some weight.  First month and a half, I lost 20 lbs!
                            I did everything Susan laid out for me and started feeling better, was not hungry between meals, stopped snacking, and was a happier person.

                        “I had IBS for 30 years and it had worsened over the years. My findings with doctors and research were that it must be personal because people suffering had different symptoms. Exhausted with several health issues; I went on a mission to find the reasons that I broke out and my digestive system was in such a mess.
                        <br><br>
                        Through a friend of a friend, I found out about Susan  Gleaton , and she designed a  program that was geared toward my personal blood work that exposed what my system did not like. I followed the program as close as I could and in 6 months my IBS was cured. Plus, I found out what rashes were from food. 
                        <br><br>
                        I highly recommend this program and I was right as it cannot be solved in a one size fits all mold. My biggest pleasure is being able to  eat salad, popcorn  and  so  many  other foods  that I can  now  enjoy  without  a  trip  to  the  bathroom.
                        <br><br>    
                        P.S. I drove an hour each way for Susan to direct me through the process. She was so caring and wonderful.”
