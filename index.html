Perhaps this is because the immune system is now "freed up' to do its job better. Whatever the reason, many people also experience relief from other symptoms such as environmental allergies, joint pain, hives, edema, fatigue, headaches, and brain fogginess.

                        Based upon reliable and accurate results from the most state-of-the-art food sensitivity test available, you'll know exactly what foods and/or food chemicals are causing your digestive symptoms. Susan will develop your individual food plan so that you always know exactly what to eat. Your diet will be expanded to incorporate a variety of healthy foods, which can then be enjoyed with no digestive repercussions at all! During this time of food reintroduction, Susan will also guide you through an individual protocol to heal the gut lining, which is where the problem often starts. This helps to assure that you do not develop new food sensitivities, which could result in problems down the road. She will also teach you how to maintain a healty gut lining by using either supplements or foods, or perhaps a combination of both.

                            “I was always bloated, constipated to some degree, muscles and joints hurt, legs were swollen by late afternoon, and overweight.  I could not lose weight; even after I had stopped eating almost all carbs (you know that low carb diet!).
                            <br><br>
                            I had tried all kinds of programs and plans, spending a lot of money, and got no results.  I was just not a happy person and somewhat depressed.
                            <br><br>
                            I started Susan’s program and was shocked to find out what foods I was sensitive to!  Susan the tailored a program for me and away we went.
                            <br><br>
                            After the first two weeks I was starting to feel better and slowly started losing some weight.  First month and a half, I lost 20 lbs!
                            I did everything Susan laid out for me and started feeling better, was not hungry between meals, stopped snacking, and was a happier person.
                            <br><br>
                            I am now in my last month of the program and feel really good and love all the compliments about how good I look due to the weight loss.  I have more energy and feel better about myself.”

It's easy to use, the recipes are easily adaptable, and one of my most favorite features: the automated grocery list—a big time saver! This program makes meal planning a breeze!”

                        “I had IBS for 30 years and it had worsened over the years. My findings with doctors and research were that it must be personal because people suffering had different symptoms. Exhausted with several health issues; I went on a mission to find the reasons that I broke out and my digestive system was in such a mess.
                        <br><br>
                        Through a friend of a friend, I found out about Susan  Gleaton , and she designed a  program that was geared toward my personal blood work that exposed what my system did not like. I followed the program as close as I could and in 6 months my IBS was cured. Plus, I found out what rashes were from food. 
                        <br><br>
                        I highly recommend this program and I was right as it cannot be solved in a one size fits all mold. My biggest pleasure is being able to  eat salad, popcorn  and  so  many  other foods  that I can  now  enjoy  without  a  trip  to  the  bathroom.
                        <br><br>    
                        P.S. I drove an hour each way for Susan to direct me through the process. She was so caring and wonderful.”

My stomach issues have been very complicated and severe for the past 8 months After seeing two GI’s and having all sorts of testing I was diagnosed with IBS. I started an elimination diet with Susan and I saw improvement but not where she thought I should be. She ordered a GI Map Test and thanks to her I was diagnosed with C-Diff. She has been great to work with. I highly recommend her. She makes things easy and she is always available to answer questions.”
